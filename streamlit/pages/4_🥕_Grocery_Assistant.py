        3. RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) mechanism is used to retrieve relavant recipe and related products for adding to the context.

        1. Recipe and product details are embedded to vector using Amazon Titan Embeddings model.

        3. When user queries for finding products to buy for a specific recipe, the recipe ingredients are embedded to vector and searched against products vector in FAISS. 
        4. The resultant products from vector search is then returned to user.

        For giving additional capabilities to GroceryBot such as 'Ordering Products', we needt to give access to more tools:

        1. For that we will use a pattern or framework called ReAct (Reasoning & Action) together with Langchain
        2. The ReAct framework could enable large language models to interact with multiple external tools to obtain additional information that results in more accurate and fact-based responses and Langchain provides Off-the-shelf chains, components & abstractions make it easy to get started. 
        3. We add more tools to our GroceryBot such as "Add to Cart" API to help ordering products.

        When user asks for 'Adding products to cart':
        1. the GroceryBot Thinks & Plan if it needs to use a tool and what tool to serve the request.
        2. The Action step allows the model to interface with tool and obtain information from external sources such as knowledge bases or environments or just an API call.
        3. The output is Observed, and this loop for thinking, planning and action continues until GroceryBot has all the information needed to fulfill user request.
        4. The GroceryBot also maintains a short-term conversation memory with LangChain during the chat so that the user don't have to repeat themselves.
        5. The products are added to cart and final confirmation is then returned to the user.

        #### Use case:
        ###### Welcome to the **Grocery Assistant**, your guide to planning and preparing a delicious dinner with ease. Imagine you are a valued customer of Cymbal Grocery, your favorite grocery store. You have a craving for a special dish, like lasagne, but you're not sure where to start or what ingredients you need. That's where our new conversational bot, GroceryBot, comes in!

        **GroceryBot** is here to assist you at every step of your dinner journey:

        1. **Suggesting a Recipe**: Simply tell GroceryBot the dish you'd like to cook, and it will recommend a delicious recipe for you to try. Try 'salad' or 'lasagne'

        2. **Getting Ingredients and Cooking Instructions**: Once you've chosen a recipe, GroceryBot will provide you with a list of ingredients and clear cooking instructions.

        3. **Suggesting Products**: GroceryBot will suggest products that you might want to buy for the chosen recipe, ensuring you have everything you need to cook your meal. Ask 'Help me find products to buy for the recipe'

        4. **Buying Products**: GroceryBot can also help you order products. Ask 'Add the products to my cart'

        5. **Finding New Products for Dinner**: In addition to your chosen recipe, GroceryBot can help you discover new and exciting products that would complement your dinner experience. Ask 'Do you have chocolate cake?'
